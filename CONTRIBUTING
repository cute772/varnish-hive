Contributing to Varnish Cache
=============================

Official development tree is here:

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vente-privee/varnish-hive/master/CONTRIBUTING

These days we prefer patches as pull requests directly to that tree.

Bugreports go there too.

Github pull requests
--------------------

Pull requests are handled like other tickets.

Trivial pull requests (fix typos, etc) are welcomed, but they may be commited
by a core team member and the author credited in the commit message.
